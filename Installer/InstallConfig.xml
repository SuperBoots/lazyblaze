    <details>Version is used so that the installer can know what version it currently is, and if LazyBlaze is already installed on a machine, what version is installed.</details>
    <details>The situation we're trying to avoid is someone with an older version of the config running a newer version of LazyBlaze and encountering errors because the format of the config has changed.</details>
    <details>Major version should be incremented when making a breaking change (a rename, a new section, etc). When major version is updated, minor version should be reset to 001.</details>
    <details>Minor version should be incremented when making a non-breaking change</details>
    <details>If LazyBlaze is creating a new user config file it will copy the version info from this file into the new user config file</details>
